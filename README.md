# Space Invaders

This is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. It is written in Java and uses the Java Swing library for the GUI.

## About the game

Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games. The aim (pun-intended) is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible. The player moves the cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and shoots at the aliens. If the aliens manage to land on the bottom of the screen, the game is over. The player can move the cannon left and right using the arrow keys and shoot using the space bar.

## Run the game

Locate the `SpaceInvaders.jar` and run it using the command `java -jar SpaceInvaders.jar`. The game should start up and you can start playing.

## How to play

Controls:

- Move left: Left arrow key
- Move right: Right arrow key
- Shoot: Space bar
